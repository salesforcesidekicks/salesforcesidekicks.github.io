"Service Blues (Hold the Line)"
(Verse 1)
Well, the phone keeps ringin’, tickets piling high,
Another angry customer, hearin' them sigh.
They say, "Where’s my answer? Where’s my crew?"
I tell ‘em, "Hold on tight, I’m just one, not two."
(Chorus)
Got the Service Cloud blues, but I’m holdin' strong,
With my trusty dashboard, I can’t go wrong.
Case by case, yeah, I’m payin’ my dues,
Livin’ every day with these Service Cloud blues.
(Verse 2)
Live chat’s buzzin’, emails pourin’ in,
Knowledge base is spinnin’—where do I begin?
Einstein’s whisperin', "Here’s what you do,"
But the queue’s so long, I’m still feelin’ blue.
(Chorus)
Got the Service Cloud blues, but I’m holdin' strong,
With my trusty dashboard, I can’t go wrong.
Case by case, yeah, I’m payin’ my dues,
Livin’ every day with these Service Cloud blues.
(Bridge)
Oh, I’m escalatin’ faster than a rocket to the moon,
Priority cases got me singin’ this tune.
But when the CSAT's up and the stars align,
I’m smilin’ like a hero, feelin' mighty fine.
(Chorus)
No more Service Cloud blues, now I’m in control,
Automation’s savin’ my weary soul.
Case by case, yeah, I’m fixin' the screws,
Turnin' those complaints into five-star reviews.
(Outro)
So here’s to the Cloud, my service-saving friend,
A ticket’s just the start, not the end.
I had the blues, but now I’m free,
Service Cloud’s the rhythm that rescued me!
