Click, Like, Convert (Marketing Cloud Anthem)
(Verse 1)
I’m scrollin’ through the feed, it’s a digital dance,
Every click and impression, my perfect romance.
Got data in my pocket, campaigns on my mind,
Marketing Cloud’s the groove, I’m one of a kind.
(Pre-Chorus)
Segment it right, make the email shine,
Personalized journeys, one click at a time.
(Chorus)
Click, like, convert—baby, that’s my jam,
Turning every lead into the ultimate fan.
From inbox to socials, I’ve got the flair,
Marketing Cloud, I’m everywhere!
(Verse 2)
Predictive scores, oh, they know what you’ll do,
Open rates rising, my dream come true.
Multichannel rhythm, I’m on fire tonight,
From SMS to ads, everything’s just right.
(Pre-Chorus)
Test and optimize, watch the magic grow,
ROI’s climbing, and the metrics show.
(Chorus)
Click, like, convert—baby, that’s my jam,
Turning every lead into the ultimate fan.
From inbox to socials, I’ve got the flair,
Marketing Cloud, I’m everywhere!
(Bridge)
Automation’s my DJ, spinning the track,
Einstein drops the beat, I’ve got data to back.
Every CTA’s gold, every journey’s tight,
Marketing Cloud’s my party, all day and night.
(Final Chorus)
Click, like, convert—baby, that’s my jam,
Turning every lead into the ultimate fan.
From personalized offers to ads in the air,
Marketing Cloud, I’m everywhere!
(Outro)
Yeah, I’m everywhere, oh, I’m everywhere,
Marketing Cloud, baby, you’ve got me there!
