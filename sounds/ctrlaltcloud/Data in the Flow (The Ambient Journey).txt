Data in the Flow (The Ambient Journey)
(Intro)
Drifting through the streams, where the data flows,
In the quiet hum of insights, the future shows.
A cloud of connections, serene and bright,
Data Cloud whispers in the still of night.
(Verse 1)
Every point, every path, comes into view,
A seamless connection between me and you.
Real-time pulses, a rhythm so clear,
The story of data, always near.
(Chorus)
In the Data Cloud, the answers breathe,
Unifying streams beneath the sheath.
Calm yet powerful, the insights grow,
In the Data Cloud, we let it flow.
(Verse 2)
From scattered silos to a single truth,
A tapestry woven in digital youth.
Einstein listens, patterns align,
Decisions emerge in their perfect design.
(Pre-Chorus)
Merge, cleanse, unify, and blend,
The journey of data, it never ends.
(Chorus)
In the Data Cloud, the answers breathe,
Unifying streams beneath the sheath.
Calm yet powerful, the insights grow,
In the Data Cloud, we let it flow.
(Bridge)
"Every record speaks, every connection tells,
A universe of stories within the cells.
Data, alive, with a pulse and a beat,
Flowing together where clarity meets."
(Final Chorus)
In the Data Cloud, the answers breathe,
Unifying streams beneath the sheath.
Calm yet powerful, the insights grow,
In the Data Cloud, we let it flow.
(Outro)
Data flows eternal, a river of light,
Guiding the way through the endless night.
