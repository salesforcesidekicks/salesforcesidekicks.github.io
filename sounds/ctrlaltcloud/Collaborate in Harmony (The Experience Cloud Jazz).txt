Collaborate in Harmony (The Experience Cloud Jazz)
(Intro)
Oh, we’re building bridges, connecting the lines,
A place for every voice, where it all aligns.
Experience Cloud, where the jazz comes alive,
A syncopated rhythm, helping teams to thrive.
(Verse 1)
Portals and pages, communities shine,
Custom-branded spaces, all by design.
Sharing ideas, like a smooth trombone,
Experience Cloud makes it feel like home.
(Pre-Chorus - Swinging Bassline)
User groups groovin’, partners chime in,
The conversation flows like a saxophone spin.
(Chorus - Big Band Energy)
Collaborate, innovate, share the vibe,
Experience Cloud, where the people collide.
From customer hubs to portals supreme,
It’s a jazzy connection, a digital dream.
(Verse 2)
Knowledge in the center, self-service on cue,
A hub for the team, and for customers too.
No more silos, no more blues,
With Experience Cloud, there’s nothing to lose.
(Pre-Chorus - Scat Vocals)
Feedback’s flying, syncopation’s tight,
The rhythm of the platform keeps it feeling right.
(Chorus)
Collaborate, innovate, share the vibe,
Experience Cloud, where the people collide.
From customer hubs to portals supreme,
It’s a jazzy connection, a digital dream.
(Bridge)
Oh, Einstein’s predicting, setting the tone,
Personalized journeys, all on my own.
Dashboards are swingin’, insights so clear,
Experience Cloud keeps the melody near.
(Final Chorus)
Collaborate, innovate, share the vibe,
Experience Cloud, where the people collide.
From customer hubs to portals supreme,
It’s a jazzy connection, a digital dream.
(Outro)
So here’s to the Cloud, where harmony stays,
Experience Cloud, jazzin’ up our days.
