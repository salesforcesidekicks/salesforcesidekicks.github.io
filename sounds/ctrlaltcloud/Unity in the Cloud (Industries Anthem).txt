Unity in the Cloud (Industries Anthem)
(Intro)
From every corner of the earth we rise,
Industries united beneath the skies.
A tapestry woven, diverse and proud,
This is the rhythm of the Industries Cloud.
(Verse 1)
Healthcare’s healing, retail’s in stride,
Energy flowing like the ocean’s tide.
From manufacturing to the public domain,
Industries Cloud sings a global refrain.
Custom-made journeys, tailored with care,
Serving every sector, everywhere.
(Chorus)
Oh, the Cloud, it knows no borders,
Breaking through the lines and crossing orders.
Industries together, hand in hand,
A world united by the Salesforce brand.
(Verse 2)
Insurance policies, streamlined and fast,
Comms that connect us, bridges that last.
Financial services, a beacon of trust,
Agriculture thriving, turning data to dust.
Every industry, every voice,
In the Cloud, they find their choice.
(Pre-Chorus)
Together we build, together we grow,
The rhythm of progress, the future we know.
(Chorus)
Oh, the Cloud, it knows no borders,
Breaking through the lines and crossing orders.
Industries together, hand in hand,
A world united by the Salesforce brand.
(Bridge)
(Energetic mix of sitar, djembe, pan flute, and strings, symbolizing unity in diversity.)
(Final Chorus)
Oh, the Cloud, it knows no borders,
Breaking through the lines and crossing orders.
Industries together, hand in hand,
A world united by the Salesforce brand.
(Outro)
One vision, one mission, one Cloud to see,
Industries united in harmony.
